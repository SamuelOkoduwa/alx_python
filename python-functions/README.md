Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
- 	What are functions
- 	How to define and call a function
-	What are parameters and arguments
-	The role of the return statement in functions
-	Difference between built in functions and user-defined functions
-	How to write functions to solve specific tasks and improve code reusability

Requirements
Python Scripts:
-	Recommended editors: Visual studio code
-	All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
-	All your files should end with a new line
-	A README.md file at the root of the python-coding repo, containing a description of the repository
-	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
The length of your files will be tested using wc

Tasks
0. a + b
-	Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
	-	Prototype: def add(a, b):
	-	Returns the value of a + b
	-	You are not allowed to import any module
-	You don’t need to understand __import__

1. a ^ b
-	Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
	-	Prototype: def pow(a, b):
	-	Returns the value of a ^ b
	-	You are not allowed to import any module
-	You don’t need to understand __import__

2. Temperature Converter Function
-	Write a Python function called convert_to_celsius that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius.
	-	Prototype: def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit)
	-	Returns the temperature in Celsius
	-	You are not allowed to import any module.
-	You don’t need to understand __import__

3. String Manipulation Function
-	Write a Python function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.
	-	Prototype: def reverse_string(string)
	-	Returns the reversed string.
	-	You are not allowed to import any module.
-	You don’t need to understand __import__

4. Fibonacci Sequence Function
-	Write a Python function called fibonacci_sequence that takes a number n as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
	-	Prototype: def fibonacci_sequence(n)
	-	Returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
	-	You are not allowed to import any module.
	-	Return an empty list if the it is not possible to generate the Fibonacci numbers for n
-	You don’t need to understand __import__

5. Prime Number Function
-	Write a Python function called is_prime that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.
	-	Prototype: def is_prime(number)
	-	Returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.
	-	You are not allowed to import any module.
-	You don’t need to understand __import__


6. Password Validation Function
mandatory
-	Write a Python function called validate_password that takes a password as input and performs the following checks:
	-	The password should be at least 8 characters long.
	-	The password should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
	-	The password should not contain spaces.
	-	Prototype: def validate_password(password)
	-	Returns True if the password passes all the checks, and False otherwise.
	-	You are not allowed to import any module.
- 	You don’t need to understand __import__
